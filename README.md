# CODEALPHA_IMAGE-GALLERY
I created an impressive image gallery, which I named "BTS Gallery." This gallery showcases all my images beautifully arranged using HTML and CSS layouts. I also implemented navigation features in JavaScript, including next and previous buttons, as well as a lightbox feature, enhancing the overall userÂ experience.
